UVM-SystemC Frequently Asked Questions
======================================

* What is UVM-SystemC?

UVM-SystemC is a new standard to develop structured verification environments 
following the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). UVM-SystemC is defined
in a language reference manual (LRM) and supported by a proof-of-concept 
implementation, implemented as a class library based on C++ and SystemC.

* What is the objective of the public review period?

Accellera solicits feedback on the UVM-SystemC standard defined in the LRM. 
Furthermore, feedback is welcome highlighting discrepancies between the 
standard and the proof-of-concept implementation.

* Does UVM-SystemC support constrained randomization?

The first version of UVM-SystemC released in December 2015 does not contain a
constraint solver for randomization. The next release planned in 2016 will 
support randomization and constraints.

* Where can I find UVM-SystemC examples?

The UVM-SystemC release contains some basic examples showing the capabilities
of the standard and proof-of-concept implementation.

* What do I need to run UVM-SystemC?

UVM-SystemC requires a C++ compiler and needs a SystemC library compatible 
with IEEE Std 1666-2011, for example the Accellera SystemC 2.3.0 or 2.3.1 
proof-of-concept implementation, both which can be found here:
http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc

* Is UVM-SystemC compatible with UVM in SystemVerilog?

The UVM-SystemC language definition aims to be fully compatible with the
Accellera UVM standard in SystemVerilog. The development of UVM-SystemC is
based on UVM 1.1, and in the process of being updated to align with UVM 1.2.
Due to some reserved keywords in C++, only a few functions and methods differ. 
In addition, the use of C++ and SystemC language concepts are promoted, 
resulting in more elegant and powerful functionality. The differences between 
UVM-SystemC and UVM-SystemVerilog are clearly indicated in the LRM.

* Is UVM-SystemC compatible with version UVM 1.1 or UVM 1.2?

Please check the language reference manual for the exact definition of the API.

* Can I mix Verification IP developed in UVM-SystemC with VIP created in 
  UVM-SystemVerilog?

The UVM-SystemC release offered by Accellera does not address multi-language
concepts. Additional libraries are necessary to interface between the SystemC 
and SystemVerilog elements. Please contact your local EDA solution provider
to check if they can offer a multi-language interface.

* Can I create register models in UVM-SystemC?

The first version of UVM-SystemC released in December 2015 does not contain 
the register abstraction layer to create register models. Creation of register
and memory models is planned for one of the next releases in 2016.

* Is UVM-SystemC supported by commercial EDA tools?

Please contact your local EDA solution provider to check if UVM-SystemC is 
supported. As UVM-SystemC is built on top of SystemC, most SystemC 
IEEE Std 1666-2011 compatible simulators should be able to incorporate 
UVM-SystemC.

* Can I verify my SystemC virtual prototype with UVM-SystemC?

Yes, any SystemC representation can be combined with the UVM-SystemC
verification environment.

* Can I verify my RTL design with UVM-SystemC?

Including your RTL design (in Verilog, SystemVerilog or VHDL) requires 
mixed-language support. Please contact your local EDA solution provider
to check if UVM-SystemC can be combined with your RTL design.

* Is there a User's Guide for UVM-SystemC?

The release package of UVM-SystemC contains a tutorial presentation, 
which contains examples showing how to create UVM-SystemC components, 
test benches and tests.

* Will UVM-SystemC become an IEEE standard?

Accellera will host the development of UVM-SystemC standard and 
proof-of-concept implementation, to ensure it develops to be a mature and solid
standard. As soon as certain quality and stability level is reached, Accellera 
will consider contributing UVM-SystemC to the IEEE Standards Association. 
It is expected that this will take some years.

* Is UVM-SystemC open source?

Yes, the UVM-SystemC language reference manual as well as the proof-of-concept
library are released under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

* Where can I find more information on UVM-SystemC?

Please visit the SystemC Verification Working Group page for more details or 
visit the Accellera forums:
http://accellera.org/activities/working-groups/systemc-verification
http://forums.accellera.org/

* How can I contribute to this initiative?

Accellera members can contribute to this project by joining the SystemC 
Verification Working Group:
http://workspace.accellera.org/apps/org/workgroup/vwg/

If your company is not member, you can find out more about  
Accellera membership here:

* What is the timeline for the next release?

Releases are created when defined milestones are reached. Ongoing major 
activities are the development and testing of the register layer and 
constraint randomization capabilities. Additional support and contributions
are highly appreciated. The Working Group's plan is to have the next version 
of UVM-SystemC in early 2016, but this is highly dependent on the progress and
number of active contributors to the development.
